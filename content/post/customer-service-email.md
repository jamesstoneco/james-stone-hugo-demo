Hi \[Awesome User\],

James Stone here from Netlify support. Sorry to hear you are having issues with your latest deploy. I am happy to help troubleshoot any issues you are facing.

Could you send me a copy of your deploy log?

Here are the steps to do this. In total it should take less than 2-minutes.

1. Visit the Netlify app and then click on the “Deploys” tab.
2. Click on the text next to the “failed” deploy
3. Click on the “Copy to Clipboard” button
4. Respond to this email and “Paste” the contents here.

Once I receive your email, I will examine your logs and write back to you with next steps.

–James
