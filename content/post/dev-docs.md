[Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/) is very well done. First, they have a very consistent and high quality product. It is shot at retina resolution and then downsampled so the video is super crisp. Second, they use professional quality microphones and audio. The third reason is that they attack bite sized chunks solving a very specific problem. They don’t waste your time with a bunch of intro material and they don’t try to cover everything. They also provide easy to find code samples and transcripts (more of a workbook) so you can quickly scan the contents of a particular video.
