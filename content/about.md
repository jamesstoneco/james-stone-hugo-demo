Hi, my name is James Stone.

I have worked at Apple, Loudeye (now Nokia), Tower Records and taught at the School of Visual Art at Penn State as an Instructor. I have worked on projects for organizations such as Eyebeam, The Symposium for the Electronic Arts, Gray Area Foundation For The Arts (GAFFTA), Zero One Art + Technology Festival, the Spencer Museum of Art and the Montalvo Arts Center. I have spoken at TEDxPSU, the HTML5 Developers Conference and the UMD Design | Cultures + Creativity Honors College.

This is my personal blog. It is focused on working with modern web technology. My philosophy is that if you want to build great products, you must have great idea([ation](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449334911/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1449334911&linkCode=as2&tag=jamestonport-20)), [stay hungry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA), [stay foolish](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/44538/what-does-the-phrase-stay-hungry-stay-foolish-mean) and [ship](http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Real_Artists_Ship.txt).

My goal is to provide you with insightful, relevant articles that you can implement today in your projects. I write about technology, creativity and marketing. Occasionally I might talk about software or tools that I found that are useful.

If you are excited about the modern web and all the possibilities it holds, then this blog is for you.

I typically post once or twice a week. To make sure you donâ€™t miss my newest posts, you can subscribe via [RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/jamesmanofstone) or [e-mail](/updates).
