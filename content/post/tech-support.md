I think there are a couple of things that I really enjoy about providing technical support. First, at its core, technical support is about problem solving. You have to understand how to troubleshoot a system and do so by translating the language that your customer is using. Sometimes this is just running through a decision tree to isolate and correct the issue, but in other cases you might find a bug, see a way your product is being used in a way you didnâ€™t expect, or come across some newly discovered issue. Even though sometimes the problems can start to be routine or have patterns, it is the one-to-one interaction with customers that keeps things fresh, as you hear new stories, get to know people a little bit, and better get to understand your product and core audience.
