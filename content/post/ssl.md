This is important for any site that accepts private data via a form. If you do not use SSL then it allows anyone on the same connection, at say a public wifi source such as a cafe or library, to capture all of this information with ease. Additional benefits are better rankings in Google, gaining access to additional keywords from Google Webmaster Tools, and generally providing an additional layer of security for your users.
