One major hurdle is that DNS is a cryptic standard, and it is not used often. Things such as apex domain and cname records are not something that every developer or web professional touches. In addition, this is often done at the start or the end of the project and isnâ€™t something that is touched day-to-day.

Another hurdle is that there is a myriad of DNS providers that all have their own interfaces, terminology and slightly different way to accessing the same information. To compound this, often a symbol such as * or @ makes the process even more cryptic for the uninitiated.
